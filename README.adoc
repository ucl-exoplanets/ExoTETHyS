ExoTETHyS is an open-source package for modeling exoplanetary transits, eclipsing binaries and related phenomena. +
It includes various subpackages with different functions. We remind to the link:user_manuals/[user manuals] and relevant papers (see below) for their rationale and detailed instructions. You can also consult the wiki with the answers to frequently asked questions (link:../../wiki/ExoTETHyS-FAQ[FAQ]).

== Getting started

These instructions will get you to have a version of the package on your computer up and running.

=== Requirements
The code is consistent with python2/3. +
The required python libraries are specified in the file requirements.txt.

=== Download and installation

==== From Pypi

Type on the terminal: `` pip install exotethys `` +
This command installs the latest stable version of the package.

==== From Github

The most updated version of the package is available on GitHub. As this version is constantly under development, stability is not guaranteed.

To download and install with a single command, type on the terminal +
`pip install git+git://github.com/ucl-exoplanets/ExoTETHyS`.

To download, then (optionally) install:

1. Go to <https://github.com/ucl-exoplanets/ExoTETHyS>, +
then click the green button *Clone or download*, +
then click *Download ZIP* to download the whole repository. +
+
_Alternatively_ type on the terminal +
`git clone https://github.com/ucl-exoplanets/ExoTETHyS`.

2. Access the root folder from terminal (you may need to unzip first).

3. After accessing the root folder from terminal, type `pip install .` to install the package. +
+
_Otherwise_, you could import the package without installation, if you run python from the root folder.

4. To test the installation, you can type:
[source, bash]
```
pytest PATH_TO_ROOT/exotethys/tests/test_sail.py  
pytest PATH_TO_ROOT/exotethys/tests/test_trip.py 
pytest PATH_TO_ROOT/exotethys/tests/boats_trip.py 
```

NOTE: The root folder name depends on the download process. It appears to be *ExoTETHyS-master* if downloaded from the web browser interface, *ExoTETHyS* if git cloned from terminal.

==== Before using

TIP: If this is the first time that you are using ExoTETHyS, you can skip this subsection.

If you had already installed/used an older version of ExoTETHyS (v1.x.y), you should delete the old database folder to avoid incompatibility issues.

NOTE: If a file from the old database is mistakenly used with this new version, *the run will fail* raising an error message. There is *no risk* to obtain wrong results.

The database folder should be located in your home: `/PATH_HOME/.exotethys`.
You could locate and remove this folder. +
This operation can also be performed by using the manage_database subpackage of ExoTETHyS, as follows:

[source, bash]
```
>>> from exotethys import manage_database as mdb 
>>> mdb.rm_database() 
Are you sure that you want to delete the directory /Users/pepe/.exotethys? [y/N]: y 
```

WARNING: *The above operation is irreversible.* It is highly recommended that you read more about the manage_database subpackage before deciding to perform this operation.


=== Quick how to run the subpackages

NOTE: The following example files are written to be launched from root directory level. +
Alternatively, the paths in the examples need to be personalized by the user.

1. *SAIL -- Stellar Atmosphere Intensity Limb* +
This subpackage can compute the stellar limb-darkening coefficients for requested targets.
+
[source, bash]
```
>>> from exotethys import sail  
>>> sail.ldc_calculate('PATH_TO_ROOT/examples/sail_example1.txt')   
```
Consult the link:user_manuals/SAIL_manual.adoc[SAIL manual].

2. *TRIP -- Transit Ring-Integrated Profile* +
This subpackage can compute transit light-curves by using stellar specific intensities rather than (approximate) limb-darkening coefficients.
+
[source, bash]
```
>>> from exotethys import trip  
>>> trip.trip_calculate('PATH_TO_ROOT/examples/trip_example1.txt')  
```
Consult the link:user_manuals/TRIP_manual.adoc[TRIP manual].

3. *BOATS -- Bias in the Occultation Analysis of Transiting Systems* +  
   This subpackage can compute the potential bias in transit/eclipse depth due to neglecting the exoplanetary flux and/or its variation with the orbital phase (common approximations). It also provides the predicted transit/eclipse depth values with the photon noise limited error bars.
+
[source, bash]
```
>>> from exotethys import boats  
>>> boats.boats_calculate_transit('PATH_TO_ROOT/examples/boats_example4.txt')  
>>> boats.boats_calculate_eclipse('PATH_TO_ROOT/examples/boats_example5.txt')  
```
Consult the link:user_manuals/BOATS_manual.adoc[BOATS manual].

4. *manage_database* +
   This subpackage can be used to manage the `.exotethys` folder that is created in your home the first time that a file is downloaded to perform a calculation. It contains 3 functions to list, copy and remove the items in this folder.
Consult the link:user_manuals/manage_database_manual.adoc[manage_database manual].
