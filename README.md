Version 1.0.2 [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ucl-exoplanets/ExoTETHyS.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ucl-exoplanets/ExoTETHyS) [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/169268509.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/169268509)

NOT UPDATED FOR VERSION 2.x.x - beta
ExoTETHyS is an open-source package for modeling exoplanetary transits, eclipsing binaries and related phenomena.

If you use this code for your research, please consider citing Morello et al. 2019, ... (arXiv:1908.09599)

## Dependencies

The code is consistent with python2/3. It makes use of
- numpy, scipy

## Download and installation
### From Pypi  
Type on the terminal:
```pip install exotethys```  
This command installs the latest stable version of the package.

### From GitHub  
The most updated version of the package is available on GitHub. As this version is constantly under development, stability is not guaranteed.  
1. Go to <https://github.com/ucl-exoplanets/ExoTETHyS/> and click the green button "Clone or download", then click "Download ZIP" to download the whole repository. Alternatively type `git clone https://github.com/ucl-exoplanets/ExoTETHyS` in a terminal window. 
2. Access the root folder from terminal (you may need to unzip first).
3. After accessing the root folder from terminal, type 
```pip install .```  
to install the package. Otherwise, you could import the package without installation, if you run python from the root folder.
4. To test the installation, you can type:

    ```
    pytest PATH_TO_ROOT/exotethys/tests/test_sail.py  
    pytest PATH_TO_ROOT/exotethys/tests/test_trip.py 
    ```
NOTE: The root folder name depends on the download process. It appears to be "ExoTETHyS-master" if downloaded from the web browser interface, "ExoTETHyS" if git cloned from terminal.

## List of subpackages

1. SAIL (Stellar Atmosphere Intensity Limb)  
   This subpackage can provide sets of stellar limb-darkening coefficients with
      - continuous ranges of the stellar parameters (effective temperature, surface log gravity, scaled solar metallicity);
      - built-in or user-defined passbands (with or without spectroscopic bins);
      - built-in or user-defined limb-darkening laws;
      - using different databases of stellar model-atmospheres.

   How to run:

    ```
    >>> from exotethys import sail  
    >>> sail.ldc_calculate('PATH_TO_ROOT/examples/sail_example1.txt')   
    ```

2. TRIP (Transit Ring-Integrated Profile)  
   This subpackage can compute transit light-curves by using stellar specific intensities rather than (approximate) limb-darkening coefficients.
   
   How to run:
   
    ```
    >>> from exotethys import trip  
    >>> trip.trip_calculate('PATH_TO_ROOT/examples/trip_example.txt')  
    ```
WARNING: running this trip\_example will consume a lot of memory (>10 GB), because by default TRIP uses 100000 annuli to compute the integral stellar flux. The user can set a different number of annuli by uncommenting the line with "n\_annuli" in the trip\_example.txt and changing the relevant number (5000-10000 should be sufficient to get a nice looking light-curve, but the absolute precision is not guaranteed).  
NOTE: The examples are written to be launched from root directory level. Alternatively, the paths in the examples need to be personalized by the user.

## SAIL configuration file
The SAIL configuration file is a text file in which each line begins with a keyword followed by one or more values associated with the keyword.

## Description of examples
**sail\_example1**: This example is to compute the limb-darkening coefficients for a single stellar target and photometric passband. It creates a file named "teff6065.0_logg4.36_MH0.0_ldc.pickle".

**sail\_example2**: This example is to test the complete output, including the stellar intensity profile and coefficients for the neighbour models. It creates three files named "teff28300.0_logg4.35_MH-0.23_ldc.pickle", "teff28300.0_logg4.35_MH-0.23_neighbour_ldc.pickle" and "teff28300.0_logg4.35_MH-0.23_neighbour_intensities.pickle".

**sail\_example3**: This example contains stellar parameters just outside the covered parameter space. If running this example, the code will exit with 2 warnings (one for each neighbour not found) and one error:
```
WARNING: teff28300.0_logg2.6_MH-0.23 cannot be calculated. Neighbour 3 not found for the stellar_models_grid Atlas_2000 .
WARNING: teff28300.0_logg2.6_MH-0.23 cannot be calculated. Neighbour 4 not found for the stellar_models_grid Atlas_2000 .
ERROR: No legal targets to calculate.
```
In particular, the code searches for the 8 nearest neighbours that defines a volume containing the requested point (28000, 2.6, -0.23 ) in the following order:  
neighbour 1: (+, +, +)  
neighbour 2: (+, +, -)  
neighbour 3: (+, -, +)  
neighbour 4: (+, -, -)  
neighbour 5: (-, +, +)  
neighbour 6: (-, +, -)  
neighbour 7: (-, -, +)  
neighbour 8: (-, -, -)  
where "+" and "-" denote a parameter value higher or lower than in the requested point. In this case the code fails to find neighbours with higher effective temperature and lower surface gravity, as they do not exist in the Atlas\_2000 database. If more targets were requested, the code would just skip this target and move to the next one. Given there are no other requested targets, the code prints the error message and exits without producing any output.  
The user can extract the information about all the available models in the grids by typing the following commands:  
```
>>> from exotethys import sail  
>>> [files_Atlas_2000, params_Atlas_2000] = sail.get_grid_parameters('Atlas_2000') 
>>> [files_Phoenix_2012_13, params_Phoenix_2012_13] = sail.get_grid_parameters('Phoenix_2012_13') 
>>> [files_Phoenix_2018, params_Phoenix_2018] = sail.get_grid_parameters('Phoenix_2018') 
```
The first variable is the list of file names in the database, the second variable is the 3-column numpy array with the corresponding stellar parameters.

**sail\_example4**: This example computes the limb-darkening coefficients for a grid of models. It creates a file named "grid_ldc.pickle".

**sail\_example5**: This example computes the limb-darkening coefficients for a single stellar target over multiple spectroscopic bins within an instrument passband. It creates a file named "teff6065.0_logg4.36_MH0.0_ldc.pickle".

**sail\_example7**: This example computes the limb-darkening coefficients for two targets with names over multiple spectroscopic bins within an instrument passband. It creates two files named "HD209458b_ldc.pickle" and "WASP43b_ldc.pickle".

**sail\_example8**: This example computes the limb-darkening coefficients for three targets read from file over multiple spectroscopic bins within an uniform passband. It creates three files named "HD209458b_ldc.pickle", "Sun_ldc.pickle" and "Cool_ldc.pickle".

**trip\_example**: This example computes an "exact" transit light-curve based on some auxiliary input files. It creates two files named "trip_ld_Teff6100.0_logg4.5_MH0.0_TESS.pickle" and "trip_ld_Teff6100.0_logg4.5_MH0.0_TESS.txt".
