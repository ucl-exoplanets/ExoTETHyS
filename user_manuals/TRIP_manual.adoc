[preamble]
== Introduction
The TRIP subpackage is designed to generate the _exact_ exoplanet transit light-curves with spherically-symmetric stellar limb-darkening.

It makes use of a table with the specific intensities instead of the limb-darkening coefficients.
The radiative transfer codes for stellar atmospheres automatically provide intensity tables.
The limb-darkening coefficients provide approximate intensity profiles to speed-up the calculations.

TIP: The aim of this code is to calculate _benchmark_ transit light-curves, that can be compared with the _approximated_ light-curves obtained from https://github.com/ucl-exoplanets/pylightcurve[faster tools]. +
This comparison offers a way to test and improve the treatment of stellar limb-darkening in the analysis of transit light-curves with photometric precision down to <10 parts per million (ppm).

I refer to the https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.09599.pdf[main article] for a detailed description of the algorithm and the results achieved so far.

== User instructions

To generate a transit light-curve you have to import this subpackage and run the trip_calculate function with a configuration file:
[source, bash]
```
>>> from exotethys import trip  
>>> trip.trip_calculate('PATH_TO_ROOT/examples/trip_example.txt')  
```
+
WARNING: Running this example will consume a lot of memory (>10 GB), because by default TRIP uses 100000 annuli to compute the integral stellar flux. +
The user can set a different number of annuli by uncommenting the line with "n_annuli" in the trip_example.txt and changing the relevant number (5000-10000 should be sufficient to get a nice looking light-curve, but the absolute precision is not guaranteed).

In the following subsection I describe the configuration file and explain the various options available. Then I discuss the examples of configuration files that are available in the GitHub repository and show how to read the file products.
